                            An IT professional with over 12 years of experience, primarily in
                            the public service sector. Originally from Texas, I went to NYU for college and fell in
                            love with the city. After receiving my B.A. in Ecomomics and Poltiics, I immediately
                            joined the US Army and spent four years on active duty.

                            After completing my tour of duty, I returned to NYC and spent ~ 10 years working in NYC
                            government, primarily in the data analysis and customer success fields.

                            However, I moved to San Diego in 2020 where I now reside with my family in Carmel
                            Valley. To further grow my formal technology skillset, I'm currently enrolled in a
                            Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp, through UC San Diego. I expect
                            to
                            graduate in late Nov, 2020 and afterwards I'm eager to dive into the web development
                            professional
                            space here in California.
